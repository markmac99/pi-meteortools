# README for pi-meteortools

# PI 
This folder contains scripts that I use post the RMS and UKMON processing, to manage uploads of
data to youtube and send me an email about how many detections there were. 

# radio_detector
Scripts and config used on my windows-based Radio meteor detector. 

# Windows
Scripts deployed to my windows desktop to collect data from my pis and review it using CMN_Binviewer, then generate various outputs for my website. This includes some scripts that do nice things like generate multicamera radiant maps create all-month stacks per camera. There are also a lot of legacy scripts i need to remove. 

# wpserver
Scripts deployed to my AWS server where further processing is done to generate nice graphs for my website. Nothing here will be of the slightest interest to you :) 

# infrastructure
Terraform to create the AWS assets used by the above.
